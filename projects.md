### üõµ Predicting Delivery Time Using DoorDash Historical Data

Built a machine learning model to predict **actual delivery time** for DoorDash orders using a dataset of historical deliveries across multiple U.S. cities.

- Processed and engineered features from **80K+ delivery records**, including time, location, store, and order details
- Created custom time-based features and handled noisy/missing timestamps using Python and pandas
- Trained and tuned a **Random Forest Regressor** using `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize delivery time predictions
- Achieved **RMSE under 5 minutes** on validation data and identified top features: `market_id`, `created_at`, and `order_protocol`
- Visualized feature importances and delivery time distributions to support operational improvements
